# Background of Bucharest

.medium[
- Bucharest is a city in transition from its communist past to a market economy
- **Problems**: 
  - Lack of effective and strictly enforced regulation and public sector indecision
  - Problems inherited from the Ceausescu regime
  - Example of poor urban planning and management

- Complex structural change following the end of the socialist regime which led to implementation of specific urban policy decisions not adequate for the current real-estate market development (Nistor et al., 2021)

- Transition from a centrally planned communist economic and political structure to its polar opposite, a free-market investment heavy real-estate market (Oliver, 2014)

- This is a map of land cover distribution in Bucharest obtained using random forest created by GEE.

- The map clearly distinguishes between urban areas, water bodies, green spaces and other land types, but whether the model is accurate or not, we can use confusion matrix to validate. 

- Furthermore, if this machine learning model is not accurate, a local survey can also be conducted to determine the urban boundary.

- We can use land cover type data or NDVI or temperature to apply city clustering algorithm (ISODATA algorithm, an enhanced clustering algorithm), then generate a cluster map.

- Based on this, We can know what category a sample point has been divided into, and return back to map, we can determine the boundaries of the city.

- Here is an output example of ISODATA cluster map:

- After trial period (1 year) restults are estimated to start appearing
  - If successful **can be applied to other cities !**

- Incorporated into SDG's healthy cities and healthy lives framework

- **Further analysis possible:**

  - time series could be incorporated to allow for prediction of urban growth
  - record where boundaries might need to be in the future
  - using framework in other countries/cities with **similar characteristics**
  
- Anticipate urban growth and change
