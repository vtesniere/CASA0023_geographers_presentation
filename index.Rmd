## Bucharest

- really old district boundaries
- not enough district boundaries
- communication between sectors is bad --> lit/examples

- Bucharest is a city in transition from its communist past to a market economy
- Problems: 
Lack of effective and strictly enforced regulation and public sector indecision
Problems inherited from the Ceausescu regime, generate many examples of poor urban planning and management

E.g. Văcăreşti “Lake

## Examples of bad urban planning in Bucharest

- no unified planning, fragmentation
- 
---
## our aim of the project
- Change the boundaries
- expand urban boundaries to enhance urban functionings, quality of life, efficiency
- what will this contribute: new approach to improve urban planning, 
- assumption the existing urban planning is changing the boundaries ---> this is new and 
- provide the current policies in Bucharest(that focus on quality of life through urban planning) and say we want to have a novel approach 
- healthy cities SDGs

---
##Aim of the project2
- quality of life
- examples of how poorly planned cities affect quality of life
- examples of how good cities planning affect quality of life
- Remote sensing is not often used for uQOL
- importance: why quality of life is important, and why district boundaries affect uQOL?
- picture of the uQOL indicator
social: social care, healthcare
econ:

### How indexes can help decide urban boundaries

- Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI): Urban areas tend to have lower NDVI values because they have less vegetation cover than rural area.

- Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI): This index indicate the presence or absence of vegetation in an area, but it performs better than NDVI because it can reduce some noise effects from atmospheric and soil conditions.

- Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI): This index can indicate the amount of water in an area. Urban areas tend to have lower NDWI values than rural areas because they have less water bodies and more impervious surfaces that prevent water infiltration.

- Normalized Difference Built-up Index (NDBI): This index can indicate the degree of urbanization in an area. Urban areas tend to have higher NDBI values because more built-up structures and materials are in urban area, which reflect more shortwave infrared light than near-infrared light.

- Land Surface Temperature (LST): This index can indicate the temperature of land surface in an area. Urban areas tend to have higher LST values, in urban area,there are more heat sources and less cooling effects because of less vegetation cover and water bodies.
